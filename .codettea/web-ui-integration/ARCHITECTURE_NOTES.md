# Web UI Integration Architecture

## Overview
Integration of the web UI with the backend API to enable users to manage features, work on issues, and configure their development environment through a visual interface.

## Key Components

### 1. Feature Execution Management
- Enable users to trigger feature development workflows
- Support both architecture mode (auto-generate issues) and manual issue work
- Real-time progress tracking of Claude Code agents

### 2. Issue Workflow Integration
- Work on next issue in sequence
- Select specific issues to work on
- Visual progress indicators for issue completion

### 3. Project Configuration
- Project selector with persistent state
- Configuration management UI
- Dynamic repository path configuration

### 4. Real-time Updates
- WebSocket/SSE for agent status updates
- Progress tracking for running tasks
- Error handling and recovery

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Enhancements
- Streaming endpoint for real-time agent output
- Task queue management for feature execution
- Session-based configuration persistence

### Frontend Components
- Enhanced FeatureList with action buttons
- IssueProgress with work triggers
- Real-time status monitoring
- Configuration validation UI

### Integration Points
- RESTful API for CRUD operations
- WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
- Shared types between packages
- Error boundary implementation

## Success Criteria
- Users can create and run features through the UI
- Real-time feedback during agent execution
- Configuration changes persist across sessions
- Graceful error handling and recovery

## Implementation Tasks

### Issue #51: Backend Execution Endpoints
Implement the server-side infrastructure for feature execution, including API endpoints, SSE streaming, and task queue management.

### Issue #52: Interactive UI Components  
Build the frontend components that enable users to trigger workflows, monitor progress, and interact with the multi-agent system.

### Issue #53: Project Configuration  âœ… COMPLETED
Create the project selection and configuration persistence layer to maintain user settings and context across sessions.

**Implementation Details:**
- Added session middleware to Express server for persistent storage
- Created ProjectContext React context provider for global state management
- Implemented dual persistence strategy (localStorage + server session)
- Added project selector component to application header
- Enhanced Settings page with project-specific configuration management
- Validation implemented both client-side and server-side
- Full test coverage with unit and integration tests

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Real-time Updates via SSE
**Decision**: Use Server-Sent Events for real-time agent output streaming
**Rationale**: SSE provides a simple, unidirectional communication channel perfect for streaming logs, with automatic reconnection and broad browser support.

### ADR-002: Monorepo Package Structure
**Decision**: Maintain separation between web, api, and core packages
**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns enables independent testing, deployment, and version management while sharing common types.

### ADR-003: Feature Execution State Management
**Decision**: Track execution state in backend with frontend polling/SSE updates
**Rationale**: Backend as source of truth ensures consistency across multiple clients and enables recovery from browser disconnections.
