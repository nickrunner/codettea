# Web UI Integration Architecture

## Feature Overview
Enhance the Codettea web UI to provide comprehensive feature management capabilities with persistent state management, enabling efficient orchestration and synchronization with GitHub and Git worktrees.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Persistent State Management
- **Technology**: SQLite database for local persistence
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, file-based, no external dependencies, perfect for desktop applications
- **Approach**: Cache-first with fallback to Git/GitHub APIs

### 2. State Synchronization Strategy
- **Delta Sync**: Only sync changes to minimize API calls
- **Background Workers**: Periodic sync without blocking UI
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with manual override option
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/SSE for live agent progress

### 3. UI Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (existing)
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Component Architecture**: Feature-based organization with shared components
- **Design Pattern**: Container/Presenter pattern for complex workflows

### 4. Data Flow
```
Web UI <-> API Server <-> SQLite Cache <-> Git/GitHub
                       <-> Agent Orchestrator
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Issue #45)
- SQLite integration with migrations
- Data models and repositories
- Basic CRUD operations
- API endpoint updates

### Phase 2: UI Workflows (Issue #46)
- Feature management interfaces
- Issue tracking and assignment
- Real-time status dashboard
- Worktree management UI

### Phase 3: Configuration (Issue #47)
- Settings management UI
- Project configuration editor
- Validation and presets
- Import/export capabilities

### Phase 4: Optimization (Issue #48)
- Background synchronization
- Delta updates and caching
- Performance monitoring
- Offline capabilities

## Key Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
- Features table with status tracking
- Issues table with GitHub sync metadata
- Worktrees table with path and status
- Projects table with configurations
- Sync_log table for audit trail

### API Enhancements
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Pagination for large datasets
- Filter and search capabilities
- Optimistic updates with rollback

### Security & Performance
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Rate limiting for GitHub API calls
- Connection pooling for database
- Lazy loading for UI components

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in GitHub API calls
- <100ms response time for cached data
- Zero data loss during sync conflicts
- 90% of operations available offline

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Consistency**: Transaction-based updates with rollback
- **Performance**: Indexed queries and connection pooling
- **Scalability**: Pagination and lazy loading
- **Migration**: Backward-compatible schema changes

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Cloud sync for team environments
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Plugin system for custom workflows
