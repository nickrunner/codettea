# Web UI Foundation Architecture

## Overview
This feature establishes the foundation for a local-first web UI to control the multi-agent development engine, providing a browser-based interface served on localhost that mirrors the functionality of the existing interactive terminal application.

## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
We chose a monorepo approach with three distinct packages to maintain clear separation of concerns while enabling code sharing:
- **packages/core**: Existing orchestration engine (refactored for API compatibility)
- **packages/api**: Express/TSOA backend server providing RESTful endpoints
- **packages/web**: React frontend application

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Express + TSOA for automatic API documentation and type safety
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type-safe UI development
- **State Management**: Context API or lightweight solution (Zustand) for simplicity
- **Testing**: Jest (unit), Playwright/Cypress (E2E)
- **Build Tools**: Nx or Lerna for monorepo management, Vite for frontend bundling

### API Design
RESTful endpoints focus on core functionality:
- Health monitoring and Claude connection status
- Feature and project management
- Issue tracking and status updates
- Configuration access

### Key Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Issue #25)
- Monorepo setup with proper TypeScript configuration
- Express server with TSOA controllers
- Service layer wrapping orchestrator functionality
- Comprehensive API testing

#### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (Issue #26)
- React application with routing
- API client services with error handling
- Core UI components for system status and feature management
- Responsive design for desktop browsers

#### Phase 3: Integration & Documentation (Issue #27)
- End-to-end testing covering critical workflows
- Developer and user documentation
- CI/CD setup for automated testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Design Principles
1. **Localhost-Only**: No cloud dependencies, runs entirely on local machine
2. **Foundation Focus**: Basic functionality only, no advanced features
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across all packages
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive testing at unit, integration, and E2E levels
5. **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, clear documentation, easy setup

## Future Considerations
This foundation enables future enhancements such as:
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Advanced UI features and visualizations
- Persistent configuration management
- Multi-project management capabilities
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

## Success Metrics
- All packages build and test successfully
- API endpoints respond within 200ms
- Frontend loads in under 2 seconds
- Test coverage exceeds 80% (backend) and 70% (frontend)
- Zero runtime type errors

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Issue #25) - COMPLETED
✅ Monorepo setup with Nx configuration
✅ TypeScript configuration with strict mode
✅ Express server with TSOA integration
✅ RESTful API controllers implemented:
  - Health check endpoint
  - Claude connection status
  - Features management (CRUD)
  - Projects listing
  - Configuration access
✅ Service layer with proper separation of concerns
✅ Comprehensive unit tests for controllers and services
✅ API documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI
✅ Development scripts and hot reload setup
✅ CORS configuration for localhost development

The monorepo structure is now established with three packages:
- `@codettea/core` - Existing orchestration engine (refactored)
- `@codettea/api` - Express/TSOA backend server
- `@codettea/web` - React frontend (placeholder for Issue #26)
