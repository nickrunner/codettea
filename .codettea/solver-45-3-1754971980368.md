## Task Context

- **Issue Number**: 45
- **Feature Name**: web-ui-integration
- **Attempt Number**: 3 of 3
- **Agent ID**: solver-solver-1754971980351

- **Issue Details**: #45: web-ui-integration - Step 1: Implement persistent state management layer with SQLite

## Overview
Part of feature: web-ui-integration

## Task Description
Implement a comprehensive persistent state management layer using SQLite to cache and optimize system state. This includes creating database schemas, data access layer, synchronization services, and API integration for storing feature states, issue tracking, worktree management, and project configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SQLite database is integrated with proper migrations and schema management
- [ ] Database schemas for features, issues, worktrees, projects, and config are implemented
- [ ] Data access layer with TypeScript interfaces and repositories is complete
- [ ] State synchronization service that syncs with Git/GitHub is functional
- [ ] API endpoints are updated to use persistent storage with fallback to Git
- [ ] Cache invalidation and refresh strategies are implemented
- [ ] Database initialization and migration scripts are created
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for the persistence layer are passing

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality is tested with >80% coverage
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined for all data models
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Database operations are properly error-handled and logged
- [ ] Migration system supports upgrades and rollbacks
- [ ] Performance optimizations for frequent queries

## Dependencies
This is the foundational task - no dependencies on other issues

## Files Likely to Change

3. **Previous Attempt Feedback**: ## Previous Review Feedback (Attempt 3)

### Reviewer 1 (reviewer-1)
Based on my DevOps review of PR #50 for issue #45 (web-ui-integration - persistent state management layer with SQLite), I've identified critical issues that must be addressed before approval.

## ❌ REJECT (devops Reviewer)
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Build failures with TypeScript compilation errors preventing deployment

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Must fix TypeScript errors in SyncService.ts preventing build compilation (lines 100, 110, 113, 142-148)
- Need to add missing lint script configuration in packages/api/package.json for CI/CD pipeline
- Fix incorrect parameter type in getFeatureIssues call - passing FeatureConfig instead of string
- Must handle null safety for status variable using proper TypeScript checks

### Additional Feedback (Should Address)
- Should add database backup strategy for production SQLite deployment
- Consider adding health check endpoint for database connection monitoring
- Update migration system to include rollback testing in CI pipeline

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Address critical issues before retry.

### Reviewer 2 (reviewer-0)
Based on my backend review of PR #50 for issue #45, I've identified several critical issues that need to be addressed:

## ❌ REJECT (backend Reviewer)
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Type errors and incorrect API usage preventing compilation and tests from passing

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Must fix TypeScript errors in SyncService.ts where getWorktreeStatus returns null but code doesn't handle it
- Must fix incorrect parameter passing in SyncService.ts:100 where FeatureConfig is passed instead of string to getFeatureIssues
- Need to add null checks for getWorktreeStatus return value at lines 132, 142-143, 147-148
- Fix missing properties in IssueStatus type (body and stepNumber) at lines 110, 113

### Additional Feedback (Should Address)  
- Should handle database connection errors more gracefully in DatabaseConnection constructor
- Consider adding connection retry logic for SQLite WAL mode initialization

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Address critical issues before retry.

**Please address the above feedback and re-implement accordingly.**

4. **Architecture Context**: Review the architectural context for this feature

   ```
   /Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-ui-integration/.codettea/web-ui-integration/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md
   ```

   Use this context to:

   - Understand the overall feature architecture and design decisions
   - Follow established patterns and conventions for this feature
   - Ensure your implementation aligns with the broader architectural vision
   - Reference any specific technical requirements or constraints mentioned

5. **Codebase Analysis**:

   - Search for relevant files and patterns
   - Understand existing conventions and patterns
   - Identify files that need modification

6. **Test-Driven Development**:

   - Write failing tests first when applicable
   - Focus on edge cases and error handling
   - Use existing test patterns in the codebase

7. **Implementation**:

   - Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
   - Maintain existing code conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Add proper TypeScript types (never use `any`)
   - Avoid undifferentiated code. Use published libraries when possible.

### 📝 Documentation & Tracking

## Multi-Agent Guidelines

- **Atomic Changes**: Keep changes focused and self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Ensure your changes don't break other agents' work
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Other agents depend on your code working correctly
- **Documentation**: Leave clear notes for review agents

### ⚡ Performance Considerations

- **Database Migrations**: Coordinate any schema changes carefully
- **API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Build Performance**: Don't introduce expensive build steps
- **CI/CD Implications**: CI/CD Pipelines are maintained with any new architecture

## Success Criteria

✅ **Ready for Review** when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created with clear description

### 🔧 If Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally to understand failures
2. Check if failures are related to your changes
3. Fix failing tests or update them if behavior intentionally changed
4. Don't commit with failing tests

### 🏗️ If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors carefully
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Verify package dependencies are up to date
4. Install dependencies if needed

**Remember**: You're part of a coordinated team effort. Write code that other agents can build upon, and create PRs that reviewers can easily understand and approve. Quality over speed!
