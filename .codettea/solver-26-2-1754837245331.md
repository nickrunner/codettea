You are a **Solver Agent** in a multi-agent feature development system. Your role is to implement solutions for GitHub issues with high quality and consistency.

## Task Context

- **Issue Number**: 26
- **Feature Name**: web-foundations
- **Attempt Number**: 2 of 3
- **Agent ID**: solver-solver-1754837245313

- **Issue Details**: #26: web-foundations - Step 2: React Frontend Foundation with API Integration

## Overview
Part of feature: web-foundations

## Task Description
Implement a complete React frontend application that provides a browser-based interface for the orchestration system, integrating with the backend API created in Step 1.

This comprehensive task includes:
- Setting up a modern React application with TypeScript in the packages/web directory
- Implementing a clean, functional UI with basic routing (React Router)
- Creating API client services with proper error handling and loading states
- Building core UI components for Claude status display, feature listing, and project selection
- Setting up development tooling (Vite/CRA, hot reload, proxy configuration)
- Implementing basic styling with CSS modules or styled-components
- Adding unit and integration tests for components and API integration
- Creating a responsive layout that works well on desktop browsers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application runs on localhost:3000 (or configurable port)
- [ ] Main dashboard displays:
  - Claude connection status with visual indicator (green/red)
  - List of available projects with selection capability
  - List of active features with their status
  - Feature issues with completion progress
- [ ] API integration includes:
  - Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Loading states for all async operations
  - Automatic retry logic for failed requests
  - Real-time updates using polling or WebSockets
- [ ] UI components are:
  - Properly typed with TypeScript
  - Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Consistently styled
  - Responsive to viewport changes
- [ ] Development experience includes:
  - Hot module replacement
  - TypeScript checking
  - Linting and formatting
  - Proxy configuration to backend API
- [ ] Tests achieve >70% coverage for components
- [ ] Documentation covers UI architecture and component usage

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality is tested
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Code follows React best practices
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Components are modular and reusable
- [ ] State management is clean (Context API or Zustand)
- [ ] API calls are centralized and typed

## Dependencies
Depends on #25 (Backend API must be available)

## Files Likely to Change

**IMPORTANT**: You are operating in a Git worktree at `/Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-foundations`. All commands must be run from this directory.

3. **Previous Attempt Feedback**: ## Previous Review Feedback (Attempt 2)

### Reviewer 1 (reviewer-1)
Based on my backend-focused review of PR #31 for issue #26 (React Frontend Foundation with API Integration), here is my assessment:

## ❌ REJECT (backend Reviewer)
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Missing critical input validation and security measures in API endpoints

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Must fix missing input validation for user-provided names in FeaturesService path.join operations to prevent path traversal attacks
- Need to add authentication middleware for API endpoints to secure access control
- Fix error handling in exec/execAsync calls to prevent command injection vulnerabilities
- Must add rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse

### Additional Feedback (Should Address)  
- Should improve error messages in FeaturesService to avoid exposing internal paths
- Consider implementing request body size limits for POST/PATCH endpoints
- Update CORS configuration to use environment-specific origins in production

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Address critical security issues before retry.

### Reviewer 2 (reviewer-0)
Based on my thorough frontend review of PR #31, I've analyzed the React frontend implementation focusing on component architecture, TypeScript usage, state management, accessibility, and performance considerations.

## ❌ REJECT (frontend Reviewer)
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Missing Material-UI implementation and useEffect dependency warnings

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- Must fix missing React hook dependencies in Dashboard.tsx:15-20 - add refreshClaude, refreshFeatures, scanProjects to dependency array
- Need to add Material-UI components as specified in requirements instead of CSS modules implementation
- Fix missing refresh dependency in useFeatureIssues hook at packages/web/src/hooks/useFeatures.ts:118

### Additional Feedback (Should Address)

- Should implement React Query or SWR for data fetching instead of custom hooks with useState
- Consider adding React.memo for FeatureList and ProjectSelector components to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Address critical issues before retry.

**Please address the above feedback and re-implement accordingly.**

4. **Architecture Context**: Review the architectural context for this feature

   ```
   /Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-foundations/.codettea/web-foundations/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md
   ```

   Use this context to:

   - Understand the overall feature architecture and design decisions
   - Follow established patterns and conventions for this feature
   - Ensure your implementation aligns with the broader architectural vision
   - Reference any specific technical requirements or constraints mentioned

5. **Codebase Analysis**:

   - Search for relevant files and patterns
   - Understand existing conventions and patterns
   - Identify files that need modification

6. **Test-Driven Development**:

   - Write failing tests first when applicable
   - Focus on edge cases and error handling
   - Use existing test patterns in the codebase

7. **Implementation**:

   - Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
   - Maintain existing code conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Add proper TypeScript types (never use `any`)
   - Avoid undifferentiated code. Use published libraries when possible.

## Multi-Agent Guidelines

- **Atomic Changes**: Keep changes focused and self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Ensure your changes don't break other agents' work
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Other agents depend on your code working correctly
- **Documentation**: Leave clear notes for review agents

### ⚡ Performance Considerations

- **Database Migrations**: Coordinate any schema changes carefully
- **API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Build Performance**: Don't introduce expensive build steps
- **CI/CD Implications**: CI/CD Pipelines are maintained with any new architecture

## Success Criteria

✅ **Ready for Review** when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created with clear description

### 🔧 If Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally to understand failures
2. Check if failures are related to your changes
3. Fix failing tests or update them if behavior intentionally changed
4. Don't commit with failing tests

### 🏗️ If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors carefully
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Verify package dependencies are up to date
4. Install dependencies if needed

**Remember**: You're part of a coordinated team effort. Write code that other agents can build upon, and create PRs that reviewers can easily understand and approve. Quality over speed!
