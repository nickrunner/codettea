- `packages/web/src/components/IssueProgress/IssueProgress.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/ExecutionStatus/` (new)
- `packages/web/src/pages/Features/Features.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/hooks/useFeatures.ts`
- `packages/web/src/services/api.ts`

## Reviewers Required
**This issue requires**: frontend

## Multi-Agent Context
This issue will be solved by automated solver agents.
Worktree: /Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-ui
Feature Branch: feature/web-ui-integration


**IMPORTANT**: You are operating in a Git worktree at `/Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-ui`. All commands must be run from this directory.

3. **Previous Attempt Feedback**: No previous attempts - this is the first implementation attempt.

4. **Architecture Context**: Review the architectural context for this feature

   ```
   /Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-ui/.codettea/web-ui/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md
   ```

   Use this context to:

   - Understand the overall feature architecture and design decisions
   - Follow established patterns and conventions for this feature
   - Ensure your implementation aligns with the broader architectural vision
   - Reference any specific technical requirements or constraints mentioned

5. **Codebase Analysis**:

   - Search for relevant files and patterns
   - Understand existing conventions and patterns
   - Identify files that need modification

6. **Test-Driven Development**:

   - Write failing tests first when applicable
   - Focus on edge cases and error handling
   - Use existing test patterns in the codebase

7. **Implementation**:

   - Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
   - Maintain existing code conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Add proper TypeScript types (never use `any`)
   - Avoid undifferentiated code. Use published libraries when possible.

### 📝 Documentation & Tracking

9. **Update Issue Progress**:

   - Check off completed acceptance criteria
   - Add implementation notes as comments
   - Update any relevant task lists

10. **Documentation Updates**:

    - Update README.md files if functionality changes
    - Update CLAUDE.md if patterns change
    - Create/update component documentation

11. **Architecture Notes**:
    Update .codettea/web-ui/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md with any architectural changes that you may have made in this issue. If no architectural changes have been made, feel free to skip this.

12. **Changelog Entry**:
    Update the changelog with a BRIEF entry of what you changed
    IMPORTANT: remember to be brief and concise
    ```bash
    echo "### Issue #52 - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
    - [Brief description of what was implemented]
    " >> .codettea/web-ui/CHANGELOG.md
    ```

## Multi-Agent Guidelines

- **Atomic Changes**: Keep changes focused and self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Ensure your changes don't break other agents' work
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Other agents depend on your code working correctly
- **Documentation**: Leave clear notes for review agents

### ⚡ Performance Considerations

- **Database Migrations**: Coordinate any schema changes carefully
- **API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Build Performance**: Don't introduce expensive build steps
- **CI/CD Implications**: CI/CD Pipelines are maintained with any new architecture

## Success Criteria

✅ **Ready for Review** when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created with clear description

### 🔧 If Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally to understand failures
2. Check if failures are related to your changes
3. Fix failing tests or update them if behavior intentionally changed
4. Don't commit with failing tests

### 🏗️ If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors carefully
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Verify package dependencies are up to date
4. Install dependencies if needed

**Remember**: You're part of a coordinated team effort. Write code that other agents can build upon, and create PRs that reviewers can easily understand and approve. Quality over speed!
