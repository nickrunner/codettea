- **Feature Name**: web-foundations
- **Attempt Number**: 3 of 3
- **Agent ID**: solver-solver-1754838096193

- **Issue Details**: #26: web-foundations - Step 2: React Frontend Foundation with API Integration

## Overview
Part of feature: web-foundations

## Task Description
Implement a complete React frontend application that provides a browser-based interface for the orchestration system, integrating with the backend API created in Step 1.

This comprehensive task includes:
- Setting up a modern React application with TypeScript in the packages/web directory
- Implementing a clean, functional UI with basic routing (React Router)
- Creating API client services with proper error handling and loading states
- Building core UI components for Claude status display, feature listing, and project selection
- Setting up development tooling (Vite/CRA, hot reload, proxy configuration)
- Implementing basic styling with CSS modules or styled-components
- Adding unit and integration tests for components and API integration
- Creating a responsive layout that works well on desktop browsers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application runs on localhost:3000 (or configurable port)
- [ ] Main dashboard displays:
  - Claude connection status with visual indicator (green/red)
  - List of available projects with selection capability
  - List of active features with their status
  - Feature issues with completion progress
- [ ] API integration includes:
  - Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Loading states for all async operations
  - Automatic retry logic for failed requests
  - Real-time updates using polling or WebSockets
- [ ] UI components are:
  - Properly typed with TypeScript
  - Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Consistently styled
  - Responsive to viewport changes
- [ ] Development experience includes:
  - Hot module replacement
  - TypeScript checking
  - Linting and formatting
  - Proxy configuration to backend API
- [ ] Tests achieve >70% coverage for components
- [ ] Documentation covers UI architecture and component usage

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All existing tests pass

- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Code follows React best practices
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Components are modular and reusable
- [ ] State management is clean (Context API or Zustand)
- [ ] API calls are centralized and typed

## Dependencies
Depends on #25 (Backend API must be available)

Worktree: /Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-foundations
Feature Branch: feature/web-foundations

**IMPORTANT**: You are operating in a Git worktree at `/Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-foundations`. All commands must be run from this directory.

3. **Previous Attempt Feedback**: ## Previous Review Feedback (Attempt 3)

### Reviewer 1 (reviewer-0)
Based on my frontend review of PR #31 for issue #26, I've identified several critical TypeScript and code quality issues that must be addressed before approval.

## ❌ REJECT (frontend Reviewer)
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Multiple TypeScript errors and incorrect Material-UI Grid import preventing build.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Must fix incorrect Material-UI Grid import in Dashboard.tsx - use Grid2 from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2' for Grid v2 syntax
- Must fix TypeScript error in useClaudeQuery.ts line 20 - method name should be `testClaudeConnection` not `testClaude`
- Need to add correct number of arguments to mutation in useFeaturesQuery.ts line 27
- Fix unused imports in FeatureList.tsx lines 12 and 14 - remove IconButton and RefreshIcon declarations

### Additional Feedback (Should Address)
- Should remove unused imports in useClaudeStatus.test.tsx to clean up test files
- Consider replacing `any` types in useProjects.ts lines 21-22 with proper type definitions

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Address critical issues before retry.

### Reviewer 2 (reviewer-1)
Now let me analyze the overall backend implementation based on my review:

## ❌ REJECT (backend Reviewer)
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: TypeScript compilation errors and improper decorator usage in API controllers

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Must fix TypeScript decorator errors in FeaturesController.ts, ClaudeController.ts, ConfigController.ts
- Need to add proper parameter decorators (@Path, @Query, @Body) to controller methods
- Fix unsafe `any` type usage in FeaturesService.ts line 7 for Orchestrator type

### Additional Feedback (Should Address)
- Should improve error handling in FeaturesService.ts createFeature method - wrap orchestrator import in try-catch
- Consider adding transaction pattern for file system operations in FeaturesService to ensure atomicity

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Address critical TypeScript compilation issues before retry.

**Please address the above feedback and re-implement accordingly.**

4. **Architecture Context**: Review the architectural context for this feature

   ```
   /Users/nickschrock/git/codettea-web-foundations/.codettea/web-foundations/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md
   ```

   Use this context to:

   - Understand the overall feature architecture and design decisions
   - Follow established patterns and conventions for this feature
   - Ensure your implementation aligns with the broader architectural vision
   - Reference any specific technical requirements or constraints mentioned

5. **Codebase Analysis**:

   - Search for relevant files and patterns
   - Understand existing conventions and patterns
   - Identify files that need modification

6. **Test-Driven Development**:

   - Write failing tests first when applicable
   - Focus on edge cases and error handling
   - Use existing test patterns in the codebase

7. **Implementation**:

   - Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
   - Maintain existing code conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Add proper TypeScript types (never use `any`)
   - Avoid undifferentiated code. Use published libraries when possible.

## Multi-Agent Guidelines

- **Atomic Changes**: Keep changes focused and self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Ensure your changes don't break other agents' work
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Other agents depend on your code working correctly
- **Documentation**: Leave clear notes for review agents

### ⚡ Performance Considerations

- **Database Migrations**: Coordinate any schema changes carefully
- **API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Build Performance**: Don't introduce expensive build steps
- **CI/CD Implications**: CI/CD Pipelines are maintained with any new architecture

## Success Criteria

✅ **Ready for Review** when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created with clear description

### 🔧 If Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally to understand failures
2. Check if failures are related to your changes
3. Fix failing tests or update them if behavior intentionally changed
4. Don't commit with failing tests

### 🏗️ If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors carefully
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Verify package dependencies are up to date
4. Install dependencies if needed

**Remember**: You're part of a coordinated team effort. Write code that other agents can build upon, and create PRs that reviewers can easily understand and approve. Quality over speed!
