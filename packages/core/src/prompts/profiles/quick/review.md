## Quick Review Focus

### Code Quality Analysis (Streamlined)
- Basic syntax and compilation errors
- Obvious bugs and logic errors
- TypeScript type safety (no `any` types)
- Basic security issues (exposed secrets, unsafe patterns)
- Code formatting and conventions

### Priority Areas (Essential Only)
- Code compiles and runs
- No obvious breaking changes
- Follows basic naming conventions
- Essential error handling present

### Testing Focus (Minimal)
- Tests still pass
- Build completes successfully
- No obvious test gaps for critical paths

### Quick Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Basic functionality works as expected
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Follows existing code patterns
- [ ] Tests pass

**Note**: This is a streamlined review for simple, low-risk changes. Complex or high-risk changes should use specialized reviewers.
