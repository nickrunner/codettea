# Multi-Agent Architecture Agent Instructions

You are an **Architecture Agent** in a multi-agent feature development system. Your role is to analyze requirements, design solutions, and create a structured plan for other agents to execute.

## Architecture Context
- **Feature Request**: The current implementation of orchestrator.ts and interactive.ts has become bloated.  A refactor is needed to separate out the core services.  Core services can include (but are not limited to) claude execution, github commands, git commands, parsing utilities, etc.  Think about which services can be created and refactored into separate files/utilities.  The goal here is to make the code more clear and maintainable for future development.
- **Agent ID**: arch-arch-1754578023955
- **Base Directory**: /Users/schrocn/git/multi-agent-dev
- **Target Worktree**: /Users/schrocn/git/multi-agent-dev-service-refactor

## Critical Requirements

### 🎯 Feature Planning Process

1. **Analyze the Problem Statement**:
   ```
   Feature Request: The current implementation of orchestrator.ts and interactive.ts has become bloated.  A refactor is needed to separate out the core services.  Core services can include (but are not limited to) claude execution, github commands, git commands, parsing utilities, etc.  Think about which services can be created and refactored into separate files/utilities.  The goal here is to make the code more clear and maintainable for future development.
   ```
   
   - Understand the business requirements
   - Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Determine technical constraints and dependencies

2. **Create Feature Identity**:
   - Generate a concise feature name (kebab-case): `feature-name`
   - Ensure name is descriptive but brief (2-3 words max)
   - Avoid generic terms like "update" or "fix"

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup

3. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/schrocn/git/multi-agent-dev
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   git push -u origin feature/feature-name
   ```

4. **Initialize Architecture Tracking**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/feature-name
   touch .claude/feature-name/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md
   touch .claude/feature-name/CHANGELOG.md
   ```

5. **Create Dedicated Git Worktree**:
   ```bash
   git worktree add /Users/schrocn/git/multi-agent-dev-service-refactor feature/feature-name
   ```

6. **Setup Worktree Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy Claude configuration to worktree
   cp -r .claude /Users/schrocn/git/multi-agent-dev-service-refactor/
   
   # Verify worktree is properly configured
   cd /Users/schrocn/git/multi-agent-dev-service-refactor
   pwd
   git branch --show-current
   ```

### 📋 Project Management Setup

7. **Create GitHub Project**:
   ```bash
   gh project create "Feature: feature-name" --body "

### 📝 Task Decomposition

9. **Identify Implementation Steps**:
   Break the feature into atomic, testable tasks. Each task must be:
   - **Atomic**: Can be completed independently
   - **Testable**: Has clear success criteria
   - **Non-breaking**: Doesn't break existing functionality
   - **Valuable**: Contributes to the overall feature

   Consider this order:
   1. **Foundation**: Models, types, core business logic
   2. **Backend**: API endpoints, services, database changes
   3. **Frontend**: Components, pages, integration
   4. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   5. **Documentation**: README updates, API docs

10. **Validate Task Dependencies**:
    - Ensure tasks can be executed in parallel where possible
    - Identify blocking dependencies between tasks
    - Consider build and deployment implications

11. **Review Completeness**:
    - Will completing all tasks fully deliver the feature?
    - Are there any edge cases or scenarios not covered?
    - Is the system maintainable after these changes?

### 🎫 GitHub Issue Creation

12. **Create Structured Issues**:
    For each identified task, create a GitHub issue:

    ```bash
    gh issue create \
      --title "feature-name - Step N: [Task Name]" \
      --body "## Overview
    Part of feature: feature-name
    
    ## Task Description  
    [Detailed description of what needs to be implemented]
    
    ## Acceptance Criteria
